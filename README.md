# Supernova Cosmology Project

This project was done as a part of Indian Space Academy (ISA) summer school. The objective of this project was to:
- Plot the Hubble diagram (distance modulus vs. redshift)
- Fit a cosmological model to derive $H_0$ and $\\Omega_m$
- Estimate the age of the universe
- Analyze residuals to assess the model
- Explore the effect of fixing $\\Omega_m$
- Compare low-z and high-z results

The assumptions made in the cosmological model is the flat $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ model. The key assumptions made are: 
- The sum of matter density and dark energy density is 1. This means there is no spatial curvature and the universe is flat. 
- Dark energy as a cosmological constant. 
- Dark matter is assumed to be cold and non-interacting except through gravity. 
- The Universe is assumed to be uniform in density and properties when averaged over large scales, and it looks the same in all directions. 
- The entire framework of these equations is based on Einstein's theory of General Relativity.
